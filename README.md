# TwoSumProblem

## Description
This project solves the classic Two Sum problem in C#: finding the indices of two distinct numbers in an integer array whose sum equals a given target. It includes two approaches: using a HashSet and using a Dictionary (HashMap). Ideal for algorithm practice and coding interview preparation with simple and effective solutions.

## Contents
- `TwoSumHashSet` method: stores seen numbers in a HashSet and checks for the complement.  
- `TwoSumDictionary` method: keeps number-index pairs in a Dictionary for fast lookup.  
- Example usage code demonstrating both methods.  
- xUnit unit tests to verify correctness of both solutions.
